/********************************************************************
	Prefix to Infix

	Write a program that reads prefix expressions  and converts them to infix. The infix expressions   
	should  be  fully  parenthesized  to  show  the  order  of  application  of  the operators. Each  
	prefix  expression  should  be entered  on  a separate  line. The  program should  keep reading  
	prefix  expressions  and  converting  them  to infix until  a blank  line
	is entered.
